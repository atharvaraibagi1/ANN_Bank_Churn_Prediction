# ANN_Bank_Churn_Prediction

# Aim: 
Predict churn of a Bank using Neural Networks to with the help of Tensorflow2.0 and Keras.
# Methodology: 
Performed a key role in building a Deep Learning model which was evaluated using
accuracy metrics. The project aims to develop Artificial Neural Network for prediction of the dependent
variable. The techniques involved, feature engineering, cleaning and handling of outliers.
